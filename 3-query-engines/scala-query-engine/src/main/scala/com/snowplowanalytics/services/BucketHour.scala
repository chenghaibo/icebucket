 * A family of aggregations that build buckets, where each bucket
 * is associated with a key and an EventType criterion. When the
 * aggregation is executed, all the buckets criteria are evaluated
 * on every EventType in the context and when a criterion matches,
 * the EventType is considered to "fall in" the relevant bucket.
 * By the end of the aggregation process, weâ€™ll end up with a
 * list of buckets - each one with a set of EventTypes that
 * "belong" to it.
